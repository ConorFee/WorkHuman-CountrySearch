# Country Search Web App
Author: Conor Fee

# Project Overview
This project is a Country Search Web Application built as part of a take-home assessment. 
The web app allows users to search for countries by name, with results displayed dynamically based on the user's input.

The application uses a frontend (HTML, PHP, CSS) and a backend(MySQl) to store and search for country names.
When a user enters a search term in the input box, the app queires a database of country names (countryName) and display's the  matching results.
